    "bioBody": "I started my career in tech as a Product Manager where I developed a passion for building amazing user experiences. My love for problem solving and my desire to get more hands on led me to Software Development and a 12 week web development boot camp. Armed with my new skills and a thirst for knowledge, I'm more excited than ever to build things! I'm naturally curious, a fast learner, and I'm always finding ways to improve - one challenge at a time.\n\nWhen I'm not coding you'll find me climbing rocks or cycling around Toronto."
